			<h3>&#10022;Monarch High School&#10022;</h3>
			<p><strong>In 2012, I was enrolled in Monarch high school and all throughout, I debated what direction I wanted to go in with my career and what to study in college. I've realized the classes I enjoyed the most involved computers and coding exercises. At the time, I was an active user of Reddit and became inspired by the structure of the site being a community to share media and create discussions with people from all over the world, with more of a freedom of speech due to anonymity. Although there were pros and cons, it was an interesting concept to me, and I became more interested in web development because of Reddit. From then on, I taught myself what I could understand of HTML and CSS, while entering community college for a General Studies A.A. with an emphasis in Information Technology. During my senior year of high school, I was also enrolled in dual enrollment at the nearby Broward Community College to earn college credit before graduation. This served to be more lucrative than just Advanced Placement (AP) classes, since the college credit would depend on passing the AP test at the end of the year‚Ä¶ In comparison to attending classes in the community college to earn the credit throughout the year if you pass the class, that seemed like the fairer choice.</strong>

			<h4>&#10022;Valencia College&#10022;</h4><!--four point stars unicode-->
			<p><strong>In the Fall of 2016, I moved to Orlando from South Florida because ultimately, I chose Valencia to ‚ÄúDirect Connect‚Äù to UCF. This school was close in proximity, with promising education, and allows me to finish my general studies to obtain an Associate of Arts degree before transferring. Since I was on an Information Technology track, I was taking classes that taught the C programming language, how to set up a coding environment, debugging, binary mathematics, and completed projects. Towards the end of my A.A. degree, I was more involved with Information Technology lessons such as Help Desk Service I, as well as an elective Web Development class. The web development class was valuable, where I uploaded my first webpage to a free web server with that class and briefly dabbled with database management. Throughout this time, I explored many different text editors and settled on Sublime Text as my favorite that I use to this day (eventually I will shell out the money to support the service as the free version does not have really any limitations, which I appreciate.)</strong></p>

			<h2>&#10022;UCF: Information Technology&#10022;</h2>
			<p><strong>In the Fall of 2018, I transferred to UCF! Ever since my time in Valencia college, I was told of the B.S. degree for Information Technology and chose that route since I only knew of that one and Computer Science at UCF, but I also thought I wanted to start in Help Desk and earn certificates to help people with technological issues. As I progressed through the program, I realized the subjects I was learning‚ÄîNetwork Administration, Security, Computer Architecture, A++ certifications, etc. were further from the content I was passionate about and although everything I learned was valuable and relevant to web services, none of my classes touched on web development anymore. I could only take electives involving web development, while teaching myself on the side along with my core courses, but nothing further. It didn‚Äôt feel right for me to continue learning on my own while taking classes in a subject I didn‚Äôt really care for, and I wasn‚Äôt grasping the IT subjects too well for a while. In the Summer semester of 2020, I switched my course program to Web Design. I had hopes of developing more creative design skills in art to aid in one of my weaknesses: graphic design and learning much more in subjects more closely related to web development.</strong></p>

			<h2>&#10022;UCF: Web Design&#10022;</h2>
			<p><strong>Now in present day, I‚Äôm considered a sophomore in the Web Design program at the downtown campus! Not all my credits from previous years transferred to this degree, but I haven‚Äôt regretted this decision at all. My graduation date was pushed back, but in these past couple of semesters, I‚Äôve learned so much more beyond the basics and was able to understand and grasp the subjects a lot better as I felt more interested in the course material as well. I was able to start and add to a portfolio page and apply the material I‚Äôve learned to personal projects. While working towards success in these classes it was an eye-opener, and a large contrast to how I was doing academically before. Hard work and dedication to these classes encouraged me to continue this path, and I‚Äôve felt more clearer in my decision to pursue this web development program as I‚Äôm excited to keep going and learn more!</strong></p>
